# Release v1.0.19

This release marks the completion of full production verification for the Linux platform and introduces cross-compiled binaries for major operating systems and architectures.

## ✨ Features
- **Opt-in ZIP Verification**: Added the `--verify` flag to perform CRC32 integrity checks on ZIP archives. ZIP files are now processed as standard binary files by default, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Full implementation of file inclusion/exclusion (`--include`, `--exclude`), size-based filtering (`--min-size`, `--max-size`), and date-based filtering (`--modified-after`, `--modified-before`).
- **Input Flexibility**: The stdin marker `-` is now fully supported for reading lists of file paths from standard input.
- **Cross-Compiled Binaries**: Pre-built binaries are now available for Linux, Windows, and macOS across both amd64 and arm64 architectures.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Stdin expansion**: Fixed a bug where `-` was treated as a literal filename instead of an input stream marker.
- **Configuration Precedence**: Environment variables now correctly override project-specific `.hashi.toml` files.
- **Error Obfuscation**: Improved error messaging for invalid hash strings, removing unnecessary security obfuscation for non-sensitive input validation.
- **Exit Codes**: Corrected exit codes for discovery failures (now returns `4` for file-not-found).
- **TOML Support**: Fixed an issue where settings under the `[defaults]` section in TOML config files were ignored.

## 🚀 Installation

### Via Go (Recommended)
```bash
GOPROXY=direct go install github.com/Les-El/hashi/cmd/hashi@latest
```

### Via Binary Download
1. Download the appropriate binary for your system from the `dist/` directory.
2. (Linux/macOS) Make the binary executable: `chmod +x hashi-<platform>-<arch>`
3. Move the binary to a directory in your system's PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/hashi`).
